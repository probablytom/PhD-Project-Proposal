\section{Developing Anthropomorphic Algorithms}

% What are anthropomorphic algorithms?
\newthought{For a long time}, sociotechnical systems analysis within computing science has developed formalisms of human-like traits, such as trust and comfort. These allow an intelligent agent to interact with other agents in its environment in measured, cautious ways: they might be used, for example, to decide whether it should accept information from another agent if its behaviour is becoming erratic (or to discard previous data which is no longer ``trustworthy'').\par

% What are their history? Establish that you're an expert in the field.
\newthought{Anthropomorphic Algorithms} are algorithms which simulate a social human trait in an artificial agent. Examples of anthropomorphic algorithms already widely researched would be ones termed ``computational trust formalisms'', versions of which are now decades old\cite{marsh1994}, but are rarely explored outside sociological and sociotechnical research.\par

These anthropomorphic algorithms are undergoing continual improvement\cite{kramdi, Urbano2014}, but some problems remain unexplored. Exploration of the techniques within the scope of AI development might yield solutions to problems of corrigibility\cite{corrigibility} and reward hacking\cite{concrete_problems} in AI safety research. The technique implies that human behaviours can apply to non-biological ``minds'', useful to philosophy of mind research\cite{sloman_spaceofminds}.\par 

Within the realm of computing science research, more anthropomorphic algorithms are yet to be developed, helping fields such as human-computer interaction to create more authentically human-feeling interfaces. Anthropomorphic Algorithms are an important area of research which can be expected to flourish in both computer science and interdisciplinary research.

\section{Future Developments}

% What good future work can be done? Introduce the idea of combined traits.
\newthought{One prerequisite to this research} is a develop a software architecture which allows for the combination of multiple traits. Current methods for designing multiple traits would involve developing a single formalism which modelled multiple traits. However, an architecture which combined these traits would permit combining sociological and psychological theories which have already been formalised, without the additional work of creating an overarching formalism for every trait combination.

% Explain the utilities of combined traits. Show that an agent with combined traits is useful practically, like building a comfortable, trusting phone without needing to develop a theory of just comfort + trust.
\newthought{Combining several traits} has a great deal of practical utility. To illustrate, one can imagine designing an interface to a mobile phone which takes into account a device's ``feeling'' of trust and comfort --- two traits which have already been formalised into anthropomorphic algorithms.\cite{Marsh2011, marsh1994} A mobile phone might have a degree of trust in the person it identifies as using it; less trustworthy users might be prohibited from accessing more sensitive information, such as medical information stored in systems like Apple's HealthKit database.\par
The device might also have a degree of comfort which is diminished when the user it identifies as using it begins acting erratically. One would expect the degree of trust it had in a previously trustworthy user to decrease as a result --- perhaps its initial assessment of the user's trustworthiness was mistaken, or perhaps its identification of its user is incorrect. If erratic behaviour in this case decreased a feeling of trust, then trust and comfort are in some way linked. \par

One can imagine similar situations where trust might affect the device's degree of comfort, where switching from a trusted to an untrusted user might result in a sharp decrease in comfort. It is important to design effective and simple ways to model these and other situations, then, so as to make the engineering of these useful systems as simple as possible. Research --- in a range of fields anthropomorphic algorithms touch, including and extending beyond computing science --- would be affected too, as the construction and testing of anthropomorphic systems would be simplified if their creation can be simplified.\par

% Explain that the best way to do this might be via software architecture. If the architecture's good, developing multiple-trait agents is as easy as developing a series of traits.
\newthought{The need} for this system, which involves the integration of several traits, should be done via an agreed-upon software architecture and a formalised method for creating these formalisms. An anthropomorphic architecture would permit the combination of several systems, without the need to develop a new formalism for each combination.\par

A good architecture would also explore the possibilities for a general format of these formalisms. For a formalism to work in the architecture, it might need to adhere to certain requirements. This lends an opportunity to develop a suitable architecture for the formalisms themselves, providing guidelines for new formalisms to be constructed against and adding coherency to the growing inventory of formalisms being studied.\par

I propose that this work is a suitably sized and impactful topic for PhD level research. I also believe that the project holds much value, due to the pressing need for the anthropomorphic architecture to be developed. I am also inspired, however, due to the fact that my own masters level research involves developing new anthropomorphic algorithms for responsibility, and that the existence of this architecture would permit exciting new research opportunities is an observation born of my own enthusiasm for the topic. \par
